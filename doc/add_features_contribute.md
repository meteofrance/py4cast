## Adding New Features

### Adding a new neural network architecture to the project

1. Neural network architectures MUST be Python classes and inherit from both **ModelABC** and  **nn.Module**, in that order.

```python
class NewModel(ModelABC, nn.Module):
    settings_kls = NewModelSettings
    onnx_supported = True
    input_dims: Tuple[str, ...] = ("batch", "height", "width", "features")
    output_dims: Tuple[str, ...] = ("batch", "height", "width", "features")
```
2. **features** MUST be the last dimension both for the input and output tensors. See our Half-UNet implementation for how to deal with that in forward pass [here](../py4cast/models/vision/conv.py#L163).

3. The **onnx_supported** attribute MUST be present and set to **True** if the architecture is onnx exportable, see [our unit tests](../tests/test_models.py).

4. the **input_dims** and **output_dims** attributes MUST be present to explicit the model's input and output tensor shapes.

5. The **settings_kls** attribute MUST be present and set to the **dataclass_json** setting class of the architecture.


```python
@dataclass_json
@dataclass(slots=True)
class NewModelSettings:
    num_filters: int = 64
    dilation: int = 1
    bias: bool = False
    use_ghost: bool = False
    last_activation: str = "Identity"
```

4. The constructor of the architecture MUST have the following signature:

```python
    def __init__(
        self,
        num_input_features: int,
        num_output_features: int,
        settings: HalfUnetSettings,
        *args,
        **kwargs,
    ):
```
**num_input_features** is the number of features/channels of the input tensor. **num_output_features** is the number of features/channels of the output tensor, in our case the number of weather parameters to predict. **settings** is a **dataclass** instance with the settings of the model.
For now we support ("batch", "height", "width", "features") and ("batch", "ngrid", "features") input/output dims.

5. Finally, the **ModelABC** is a Python **ABC** which forces you to implement all the required attributes or there will an Exception raised.

Now your model can be either registered explicitely in the system (in case the code is in this repository) or injected in the system as a plugin (in case the code is hosted on a third party repository).

1. Model in the same git repository

Add your **NewModel** class to the registry explicitly in the models package [__init__.py](../py4cast/models/__init__.py)

```python
registry = {}
for kls in (HalfUnet, Unet, GraphLAM, HiLAM, HiLAMParallel, Segformer, NewModel):
    registry[kls.__name__.lower()] = kls
```

2. Model as a third party plugin

In order to be discovered, your model Python class MUST:

* be contained in a python module prefixed with **py4cast_plugin_**
* inherit from **ModelABC** and **nn.Module**
* have a different name than the models already present in the system
* be discoverable by the system (e.g. in the PYTHONPATH or pip installed)

We provide an example module [here](../py4cast_plugin_example.py) to help you create your own plugin. This approach is based on the [official python packaging guidelines](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/).


### Adding a new dataset

1. Your dataset **MUST** inherit from **DatasetABC** and **data.Dataset**, in thats order.

```python
class TitanDataset(DatasetABC, Dataset):
    ...
```

2. Your dataset **MUST** implement
    * ALL the abstract properties from **DatasetABC**: `dataset_info`, `meshgrid`, `geopotential_info` and `cache_dir`.
    * ALL the abstract methods from **DatasetABC**: `torch_dataloader` and `from_json`.
    * 2 methods from **data.Dataset**: `__len__` and `__getitem__`.

3. Your `__getitem__` method MUST return an Item object.

```python
    def __getitem__(self, index: int) -> Item:
        ...
```

4. It is MANDATORY that your `__getitem__` method returns [Item](../py4cast/datasets/base.py#L288) instances containing NamedTensors with precise feature and dimension names. By convention we use these names for tensor dimensions: **("batch", "timestep", "lat", "lon", "features")**.

5. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that your dataset implements a `prepare` method to easily compute and save all the statics needed by your dataset.


### Adding Training Plots

Plots are done using the **matplotlib** library. We wrap each plot in a **ErrorObserver** class. Below is an example of a plot that shows the spatial distribution of the error for all the variables together. See our [observer.py](../py4cast/observer.py#L40) for more examples.

```python
class SpatialErrorPlot(ErrorObserver):
    """
    Produce a map which shows where the error are accumulating (all variables together).
    """

    def __init__(self, prefix: str = "Test"):
        self.spatial_loss_maps = []
        self.prefix = prefix

    def update(
        self,
        obj: "AutoRegressiveLightning",
        prediction: NamedTensor,
        target: NamedTensor,
    ) -> None:
        spatial_loss = obj.loss(prediction, target, reduce_spatial_dim=False)
        # Getting only spatial loss for the required val_step_errors
        if obj.model.info.output_dim == 1:
            spatial_loss = einops.rearrange(
                spatial_loss, "b t (x y) -> b t x y ", x=obj.grid_shape[0]
            )
        self.spatial_loss_maps.append(spatial_loss)  # (B, N_log, N_lat, N_lon)

    def on_step_end(self, obj: "AutoRegressiveLightning") -> None:
        """
        Make the summary figure
        """
```

In order to add your own plot, you can create a new class that inherits from **ErrorObserver** and implement the **update** and **on_step_end** methods. You can then add your plot to the **AutoRegressiveLightning** class in the **valid_plotters** or [**test_plotters** list](../py4cast/lightning.py#L398).

```python
self.test_plotters = [
    StateErrorPlot(metrics),
    SpatialErrorPlot(),
    PredictionPlot(self.hparams["hparams"].num_samples_to_plot),
]
```

## Contribution guidelines

Anyone can contribute through a merge request. The code must pass the unit tests and continuous integration before it is merged.

### Unit tests

We provide a first set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the codebase. You can run them using the following command:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Our tests cover:
- The NamedTensor class
- The models, we make sure they can be instanciated and trained in a pure PyTorch training loop.

## Linting/Reformating your code

You can run the same linting checks the CI does :

```
runai exec ./lint.sh .
```

And also reformat your code (black, isort) :
```
runai exec ./reformat.sh .
```

For conda users remove the **runai exec** prefix.


### Continuous Integration

We have a github pipeline that runs linting (flake8, isort, black, bandit) and tests on every push to the repository. See the [github workflow](../.github/workflows/tests.yml) file for more details.

Our CI also launches two runs of the full system (*bin/train.py*) with our **Dummy** dataset using **HiLam** and **HalfUnet32**.

```bash
python bin/train.py --model hilam --dataset dummy --epochs 1 --batch_size 1 --num_pred_steps_train 1 --limit_train_batches 1
```
